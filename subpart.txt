We used 3 different classification algorithm. With the first look it looks like SVM should be an appropriate choice for the model but on analysis,
we realse that RandomForestClassifier performs the best because the dataset is quite big and if we have enough number of trees, overfitting can be easily avoided.

We could also have developed a neural network for the same and it sure would have performed better than others. Apart from that as it is a high dimensional
we can easily discard LogisticRegression.

We got an accuracy of around 90% using RFC but it can be increased if we do appropriate tuning of parameters and feature selection can also be done in a better way.

Although we have calculated only accuracy for the model, some other parameters like Recall score, precision score, f1 score, etc can be used.
